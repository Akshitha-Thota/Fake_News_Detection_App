# Fake News Detection Project

## üìå Overview

The topic of fake news detection on social media has recently attracted tremendous attention. The basic countermeasure of comparing websites against a list of labeled fake news sources is inflexible, and so a machine learning approach is desirable.

Our project aims to use Machine Learning algorithms to detect fake news directly, based on the **text content** of news articles.

## ‚ùì Problem Definition

The goal is to develop a machine learning program to identify when a news source may be producing fake news.

- We aim to use a **corpus of labeled real and fake news articles** to build a classifier.
- The model will focus on identifying **fake news sources** based on **multiple articles** originating from a source.
- Once a source is labeled as a fake news producer, we can confidently flag future articles from that source as fake.
- This approach reduces article-level misclassification by leveraging **source-level data**.

üìå The intended application is to apply **visibility weights** in social media platforms.  
Using the model's output, platforms can **reduce the visibility** of content likely to be fake.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akshitha-Thota/Fake_News_Detection_App.git
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Use the package manager `pip` to install required libraries.

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
```bash
virtualenv env_name
```
```bash
env_name/scripts/activate
```
